Nearly 600 million people in India practice open defecation which causes chronic diarrhea that leads to stunting. 1,000 young lives are lost every day due to diarrhea. With the objective of impacting knowledge, attitudes and practices around sanitation and hygiene-related behavior, Sesame Workshop India Trust supported by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, launched the Cleaner, Healthier, Happier campaign (Raho Swacch, Jiyo Mast) in November of 2014.
