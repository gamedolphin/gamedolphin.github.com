Hi! I am Sandeep (pronounced Sun-deep). I work at [coherence](https://www.coherence.io) on multiplayer magic. I am a self taught programmer and I take pride in the multiple projects I have worked on and the teams I have worked with. I spend my time reading programming texts and consider myself a 'forever student', eager to learn new things everyday. 

I play the piano and the guitar and am trained in Carnatic classical singing. I cannot sing anymore but I can help you appreciate the music.

I am a self effacing Lisp and Emacs nerd and I would eventually get you to use Emacs if you spend enough time with me.
