Which means that dynamic user generated content (like comments) is going to be hard. \nBut I have recently discovered giscus. It is a comment system powered by github discussions. And since my website is almost completely run on top of github (pages and actions), it makes sense to keep the comments on my posts inside of it. \nAfter you run through the configuration wizard on the home page and added the giscus app and settings to your repository, you are presented with a handy script tag that you can add to your page. \n&lt;script src=\"https://giscus.app/client.js\"\n        data-repo=\"gamedolphin/gamedolphin.github.com\"\n        data-repo-id=\"R_kgDOMgpr2g\"\n        data-category=\"Announcements\"\n        data-category-id=\"DIC_kwDOMgpr2s4ChgX6\"\n        data-mapping=\"pathname\"\n        data-strict=\"0\"\n        data-reactions-enabled=\"1\"\n        data-emit-metadata=\"0\"\n        data-input-position=\"top\"\n        data-theme=\"noborder_gray\"\n        data-lang=\"en\"\n        data-loading=\"lazy\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nAdding to zola\nTo add this script to all \"pages\" (not a page index like the blog), I can extend the theme's page.html template by creating a new templates/page.html.

This provides an immutable, stable system.\nAnd when I break it, I can just revert to the previous stable version.\nI might have destroyed my linux knowledge because of this. I now fix things through Nix configuration instead.\nOver the holidays, I also spent some time learning to use org mode inside Emacs.\nIt's a bunch of things packed into a super powerful built-in plugin.\nI have seen many \"literate\"  emacs configurations in the wild.\nThey are just long org documents that also behave as the configuration file for emacs itself.\nWell, if you can configure emacs using this, then surely you can configure your whole system if you combine it with nixos.\nAnd that is exactly what I did.\nYou can find my literate system configuration here.\nIt describes (and configures) all the software for both my workstations (the wfh desktop and travel laptop).\nI also managed to integrate sops this time around and so the repo actually completely configures my system, including secrets like ssh and api keys.\nThe expected workflow for me, going forward, is to edit the README file to make my changes and then run org-tangle to generate the nix files.\nOnce the nix files are ready, I can do the usual nixos-rebuild to apply the changes.\nI have added a snippet at the bottom of the README that actually adds a \"DO NOT MODIFY\" header to all the generated files.\nThis should be fair warning, mainly for me, to not edit these directly, lest I forget and risk losing those changes.\n  (progn\n    (defun add-tangle-headers ()\n      (message \"running in %s\" (buffer-file-name))\n      (when (string= (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name)) \"nix\")\n        (goto-char (point-min))\n        (insert \"# WARNING : This file was generated by README.org\\n# DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE!\\n# Any changes made here will be overwritten.\\n\")\n        (save-buffer))\n      (save-buffer))\n    (add-hook 'org-babel-post-tangle-hook 'add-tangle-headers))\n\nGithub CI/CD\nFinally, the github repo also has a github action configured to run the tangling automatically on changing the README.\nThat will keep the generated files up to date in case I forget to push them.\nI could have skipped adding the generated files BUT nix flakes behaves wierdly if some files are in git, and others are not.\nIt just makes life easier when applying the changes.\nThe only addition here is that the tangling command has to allow the header insertion code to run. That is why the command looks this long in the action.\nemacs README.org --batch --eval \"(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)\" --eval \"(progn (require 'org) (org-babel-goto-named-src-block \\\"startup\\\") (org-babel-execute-src-block))\" -f org-babel-tangle\n\nThis should also keep me from breaking the tangling setup.\nJust read it\nYou can just read the file and see how I've setup my computer. You can also just read the raw file to see how I've setup org mode tangling! This setup gives me a documented, reproducible system configuration that's easy to maintain and share. Cheers!\n","id":"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/blog/literate-nixos/","title":"Literate System Configuration"},"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/blog/managing-secrets-nixos/":{"body":"I use a bunch of \"secret\" keys on my computer. A good example is the Anthropic Claude LLM API key that lets me talk to Claude through emacs's gptel plugin. But if I am setting up a new computer, or moving between workstations, I need to manually copy the key over to its expected location. If I could just commit the secrets to the literate system configuration that I maintain, I can just git pull and have the key on the other computer, ready to use. I can also version control my secrets!\nBut of course, you do not want to commit secret api keys into a git repository! Thats where sops and its integration with nixos, sops-nix comes in!\nSops allows you to encrypt your secrets and push them up like any other file. Only you can decrypt them and use them.\n\n⚠️ Security Note:\nThe security of this approach depends entirely on keeping your encryption key safe. Never commit unencrypted keys or share them insecurely.\nWhile this method is convenient, the most secure approach is keeping secrets completely separate from public repositories.\n\nSo, how do you integrate sops on nixos? I think the nix-sops github README has a very good tutorial which you can go through. But I'll outline the steps I did for my own setup.\nAdding sops-nix to the configuration\nThis is the easy step. Add sops-nix as an input, and add the provided module to your list of modules.\n{\n    inputs.sops-nix.url = \"github:Mic92/sops-nix\";\n\n    outputs = { self, nixpkgs, sops-nix }: {\n        nixosConfigurations.${hostname} = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {\n            inherit system;\n            modules = [\n                # rest of your modules\n                # ...\n                sops-nix.nixosModules.sops\n            ];\n        };\n    };\n}\n\nGenerate encryption key\nNext, we need to generate a key that we will use to encrypt our secrets. This can piggy-back on top of your existing ssh key, but I decided to generate my own using age. On nixos, getting the age-keygen command was as simple as nix-shell -p age\n    mkdir -p ~/.config/sops/age\n    age-keygen -o ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt\n\n\n💡 Tip:\nBackup this key securely! Without it, you won't be able to decrypt your secrets.\n\nI have saved this key in multiple secure locations for easy future retrieval.\nWe also need the public key for this file, which can be found using the age-keygen command as well\n    age-keygen -y ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt\n\nSops configuration\nWe need to create a .sops.yaml file at the root of our configuration directory to tell sops about how we're planning to use/manage our secrets.\nkeys:\n  - &amp;primary age1yq35g6mmlem0rhr47u6ewh8dctlwp9hj0s0ac60e4hrw9hjzlqms6crf7n\ncreation_rules:\n  - path_regex: secrets/secrets.yaml$\n    key_groups:\n      - age:\n        - *primary\n\nThis tells sops a few things:\n\nThe public key (which we got from the last bash command) for our private secret key.\nThe path to the actual secrets file when creating secrets and which key (in our case, \"primary\") to use to encrypt/decrypt the secrets.\n\nAdding the secrets\nNow we can actually add and manage the secrets. To start, you can tell sops to decrypt and provide you a file that you can edit in the $EDITOR of your choice.\n    sops --run \"sops secrets/secrets.yaml\"\n\nThis decrypts (or creates) a secrets/secrets.yaml file and opens it in $EDITOR. You can add, remove and modify secrets in this file and sops will encrypt the file on exit.\n   claude_key: super-secret-unecrypted-api-key-that-i-want-to-keep-secret\n\nOnce I exit the $EDITOR, the file looks like this\n    claude_key: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:PMPcEfsKZCALRdgQf5J12k8IsxlNT7R+zfSgmy3LbVhvQQzpCEVr5Xjh6ABhDRGjsTssXc1Vh7FA03oud40i5YxoYwJ2i2EqrRmpp/QNVAfbPrOzfCcwUxlbgJOUEMVv/1RJFYeqddi+bf1F,iv:lD1bRtBtnBf0ub5mGznVuoxLcFcJhxdp+mGv5TMBcKQ=,tag:TP6YLujPHFmFnK5gWwTREg==,type:str]\n    ... other things\n\nThis file can now be safely committed to the git repository.\nWe must tell sops-nix about these files as well. That is done through a few lines of nix configuration.\n{\n    # where are the secrets\n    sops.defaultSopsFile = ../secrets/secrets.yaml;\n\n    # the key to decrypt the secrets\n    sops.age.keyFile = \"/home/&lt;username&gt;/.config/sops/age/keys.txt\";\n}\n\nAccessing secrets\nThe final step is telling sops to allow users to access the secrets. I want my logged in user to see the claude_key secret so that emacs can read it.\nThis is done through a few additional lines of nix configuration.\n    {\n       sops.secrets.claude_key = {\n         owner = \"${user.username}\";\n       };\n    }\n\nHere, I specify that the owner of the secret is the user. Otherwise, by default, root is the owner, and normal user cannot read the secret.\nOnce configured, your secrets are available at /run/secrets/secret_name. For example, to use the Claude API key in Emacs:\n(setq gptel-api-key\n      (with-temp-buffer\n        (insert-file-contents \"/run/secrets/claude_key\")\n        (string-trim (buffer-string))))\n\nTroubleshooting\nCommon issues and solutions:\n\nPermission denied: Check the owner setting in your sops configuration\nDecryption failed: Ensure your age key is correctly configured\nSecret not found: Verify the path in defaultSopsFile\n\nUseful Resources\n\nsops-nix GitHub Repository\nAge encryption tool\nMozilla sops documentation\n\nConclusion\nSops has allowed me to not worry about managing secrets separately from my nixos configuration. When I switch workstations, a simple git pull lets me access all my latest secrets and keys!\n","id":"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/blog/managing-secrets-nixos/","title":"Managing Secrets in Nixos with Sops"},"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/byol/":{"body":"\nOur entry in Indie Speed Run 3.0, BYOL, is picked among the most addictive games from hundreds of games across the world.\n\nRole - Lead Game Dev\n\nTechnologies Used\n\nCocos2d-Js\n\n\nCheck it out here.\n","id":"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/byol/","title":"B.Y.O.L"},"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/gamebaaz/":{"body":"\nYou get 10 points to bet on each match and the result and odds determine your eventual points.

It acts as an abstraction layer over the platform rendering APIs along with some sauce for added efficiency. It also has bindings to most popular languages including C#, F#, D, Go, Haskell, Python, Rust and Swift. I don't claim to have built anything substantial with bgfx, but I did manage to figure out how to get a square on screen. The documentation and examples are thorough but they do not hold your hand through the process. So let me.\n\nDisclaimer: This tutorial is a result of initial exploration with bgfx and getting a square on screen. I do not claim to have the best makefiles, memory safe code or efficient methods. Those topics are for future tutorials.\n\nPrior Knowledge\nbgfx is quite close to the metal innards of 3d rendering, being just a thin wrapper. So I would highly recommend going through this OpenGL Tutorial to get comfortable with how modern 3d rendering works. It would really help in making sense of what bgfx is doing at any moment.\nProject setup\nbgfx only handles the rendering, which means we need to use a windowing library (the brave can use the platform code directly, be my guest). I chose SDL. Ensure your system has SDL dev libraries installed along with bgfx dependencies on Ubuntu.\nsudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0 libgl1-mesa-dev x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev\n\nOk, for the sake of this tutorial, lets make a simple C++ project, starting with a Makefile that links up SDL2, GL, X11, DL, pthread and rt libraries.\n# CC specifies which compiler we're using\nCC = g++\n\n# COMPILER_FLAGS specifies the additional compilation options we're using\n# -w suppresses all warnings\nCOMPILER_FLAGS = -w\n\n# LINKER_FLAGS specifies the libraries we're linking against\nLINKER_FLAGS = -lSDL2 -lGL -lX11 -ldl -lpthread -lrt\n\n# This is the target that compiles our executable\nall : main.cpp\n    $(CC) main.cpp -o  main $(COMPILER_FLAGS) $(LINKER_FLAGS)\n\nAnd lets add a simple main.cpp file as well.\nint main ( int argc, char* args[] ) {\n  return 0;\n}\n\nYou should try and run make and then run the program to see if everything is setup correctly.\nmake all &amp;&amp; ./main\n\nGetting a window on screen\nAs mentioned earlier, we would be using SDL to create a window and poll for events. The code for that is fairly straight forward. If you need to understand more about setting up SDL, I recommend going through LazyFoo's SDL tutorial series.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;SDL2/SDL.h&gt;\n#include &lt;SDL2/SDL_syswm.h&gt;\n\nSDL_Window* window = NULL;\nconst int WIDTH = 640;\nconst int HEIGHT = 480;\nint main (int argc, char* args[]) {\n\n  // Initialize SDL systems\n  if(SDL_Init( SDL_INIT_VIDEO ) &lt; 0) {\n    printf(\"SDL could not initialize! SDL_Error: %s\\n\",\n           SDL_GetError());\n  }\n  else {\n    //Create a window\n     window = SDL_CreateWindow(\"BGFX Tutorial\",\n                                SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED,\n                                SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED,\n                                WIDTH, HEIGHT,\n                                SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);\n    if(window == NULL) {\n      printf(\"Window could not be created! SDL_Error: %s\\n\",\n             SDL_GetError());\n    }\n  }\n\n\n  // Poll for events and wait till user closes window\n  bool quit = false;\n  SDL_Event currentEvent;\n  while(!quit) {\n    while(SDL_PollEvent(&amp;currentEvent) != 0) {\n      if(currentEvent.type == SDL_QUIT) {\n        quit = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Free up window\n  SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n  // Shutdown SDL\n  SDL_Quit();\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\nCompiling and running the program at this point should get you something like the following image.\n\nGetting and building BGFX\nFirst clone the bgfx repository and its dependencies bx and bimg libraries into the project.\ngit clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bx.git\ngit clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bimg.git\ngit clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx.git\n\nThen lets build bgfx.\ncd bgfx\nmake linux-release64\n\nIf you following along on anything other than an Ubuntu system, you can find instructions to build bgfx here.\nAt the end of this process, you'll have a bunch of library files and executables sitting in the bgfx/.build/linux64_gcc/bin folder. Let us link them in the makefile.\nBGFX_HEADERS =  -Ibgfx/include -Ibx/include -Ibimg/include\n\n# Update linker flags to include the shared library that you just built\nLINKER_FLAGS = bgfx/.build/linux64_gcc/bin/libbgfx-shared-libRelease.so -lSDL2 -lGL -lX11 -ldl -lpthread -lrt\n\n#This is the target that compiles our executable\nall : main.cpp\n    $(CC) main.cpp -o  main $(COMPILER_FLAGS) $(LINKER_FLAGS) $(BGFX_HEADERS)\n\nI've linked the shared version to make compile faster, but you can also link the static library libbgfxRelease.a if you want.\nInitializing BGFX\nNow that the window is ready and bgfx is linked, lets initialize bgfx in our code.\n#include &lt;bgfx/bgfx.h&gt;\n#include &lt;bgfx/platform.h&gt;\n#include &lt;SDL2/SDL_syswm.h&gt;\n\n// Other includes and after opening the window\n...\n\n  // Collect information about the window from SDL\n  SDL_SysWMinfo wmi;\n  SDL_VERSION(&amp;wmi.version);\n  if (!SDL_GetWindowWMInfo(window, &amp;wmi)) {\n    return 1;\n  }\n\n  bgfx::PlatformData pd;\n  // and give the pointer to the window to pd\n  pd.ndt = wmi.info.x11.display;\n  pd.nwh = (void*)(uintptr_t)wmi.info.x11.window;\n\n  // Tell bgfx about the platform and window\n  bgfx::setPlatformData(pd);\n\n  // Render an empty frame\n  bgfx::renderFrame();\n\n  // Initialize bgfx\n  bgfx::init();\n\n  // Reset window\n  bgfx::reset(WIDTH, HEIGHT, BGFX_RESET_VSYNC);\n\n  // Enable debug text.\n  bgfx::setDebug(BGFX_DEBUG_TEXT /*| BGFX_DEBUG_STATS*/);\n\n  // Set view rectangle for 0th view\n  bgfx::setViewRect(0, 0, 0, uint16_t(WIDTH), uint16_t(HEIGHT));\n\n  // Clear the view rect\n  bgfx::setViewClear(0,\n                     BGFX_CLEAR_COLOR | BGFX_CLEAR_DEPTH,\n                     0x443355FF, 1.0f, 0);\n\n  // Set empty primitive on screen\n  bgfx::touch(0);\n\n\n  /*\n  Put this inside the event loop of SDL, to render bgfx output\n  */\n  bgfx::frame();\n\n\n  /*\n  And put this just before SDL_Quit()\n  */\n  bgfx::shutdown();\n...\n\n\nYou should see a pleasant purple being rendered in the window now.\n\nVertices and Indices\nIf you went through the OpenGL tutorial linked above, you would know that getting a triangle on screen isn't as simple anymore. We need to define a few things before we can see any action on screen. These include:\n\nThe vertex buffer: a list of 3d vertices that define what your 3d shape looks like in normalized space.\nThe index buffer: a list of vertex indices that define which of the vertices in the vertex buffer form a triangle.\nA vertex and a fragment shader which compute how each of the vertices are renderered and colored on the screen.\nA vertex attribute declaration which translate what your vertex buffer means for the shaders.\n\nWe know each of the vertices of the square would have a 3 points that denote where the vertex is in space, and lets also have a 4th variable that represents the color of the vertex. We hold these values in a struct and use bgfx::VertexDecl to define the vertex attribute declaration.\nstruct PosColorVertex {\n    // 3d space position\n    float m_x;\n    float m_y;\n    float m_z;\n    // Color value\n    uint32_t m_abgr;\n\n    static void init() {\n        // start the attribute declaration\n        ms_decl\n            .begin()\n            // Has three float values that denote position\n            .add(bgfx::Attrib::Position, 3, bgfx::AttribType::Float)\n            // and a uint8 color value that denotes color\n            .add(bgfx::Attrib::Color0,   4, bgfx::AttribType::Uint8, true)\n            .end();\n    };\n\n    static bgfx::VertexDecl ms_decl;\n};\n\nbgfx::VertexDecl PosColorVertex::ms_decl;\n\nLets define the vertices that form our square.\nstatic PosColorVertex s_cubeVertices[] =\n{\n    {  0.5f,  0.5f, 0.0f, 0xff0000ff },\n    {  0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f, 0xff0000ff },\n    { -0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f, 0xff00ff00 },\n    { -0.5f,  0.5f, 0.0f, 0xff00ff00 }\n};\n\nAnd the indexes of the vertices that form two triangles to make a square.\nstatic const uint16_t s_cubeTriList[] =\n{\n    0,1,3,\n    1,2,3\n};\n\nWe also need a bgfx::VertexBufferHandle variable to hold the actual vertex buffer and a bgfx::IndexBufferHandle variable to hold the index buffer.\nbgfx::VertexBufferHandle m_vbh;\nbgfx::IndexBufferHandle m_ibh;\n\nNow we need to initialize the vertex buffer handle and the index buffer handle with the vertices and triangle we have defined above. Put this after bgfx::init().\nPosColorVertex::init();\nm_vbh = bgfx::createVertexBuffer(\n            // Static data can be passed with bgfx::makeRef\n            bgfx::makeRef(s_cubeVertices, sizeof(s_cubeVertices)),\n            PosColorVertex::ms_decl\n        );\n\nm_ibh = bgfx::createIndexBuffer(\n            // Static data can be passed with bgfx::makeRef\n            bgfx::makeRef(s_cubeTriList, sizeof(s_cubeTriList))\n        );\n\nShaders\nbgfx has a shader language very close to glsl with a few caveats. You can read about it on this page. We need a vertex shader and a fragment shader to render our square on the screen. Lets start with the vertex shader in a new file and name it v_simple.sc.\n$input a_position, a_color0\n$output v_color0\n\n#include &lt;bgfx_shader.sh&gt;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    gl_Position = mul(u_modelViewProj, vec4(a_position, 1.0) );\n    v_color0 = a_color0;\n}\n\nbgfx_shader.sh has many useful macros that we can use in our shaders. We use the u_modelViewProj variable from the file to get a projection of our position into the screen and we pass on the color as it is.\nLet's create a fragment shader and name it f_simple.sc.\n$input v_color0\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    gl_FragColor = v_color0;\n}\n\nThe fragment shader just returns the color as it is.\nbgfx requires another file apart from just the vertex and fragment shaders called varying.def.sc which defines the input and output variables being used in these shaders. Lets create that as well.\n// outputs\nvec4 v_color0 : COLOR0;\n\n// inputs\nvec3 a_position : POSITION;\nvec4 a_color0 : COLOR0;\n\nNow we need to compile these shaders before we can use them with bgfx. The tool for that was built along with the bgfx library. You can find the tool shadercRelease in bgfx/.build/linux64_gcc/bin.\nLets run the shaderc tool to create our compiled shader files.\n./bgfx/.build/linux64_gcc/bin/shadercRelease \\\n    -f v_simple.sc \\\n    -o v_simple.bin \\\n    --platform linux \\\n    --type vertex \\\n    --verbose \\\n    -i bgfx/src\n./bgfx/.build/linux64_gcc/bin/shadercRelease \\\n    -f f_simple.sc \\\n    -o f_simple.bin \\\n    --platform linux \\\n    --type fragment \\\n    --verbose \\\n    -i bgfx/src\n\nWe can add these lines to our make file as well so that the shaders are recompiled when we build.\n#This is the target that compiles our executable\nall : main.cpp\n    ./bgfx/.build/linux64_gcc/bin/shadercRelease \\\n    -f v_simple.sc \\\n    -o v_simple.bin \\\n    --platform linux \\\n    --type vertex \\\n    --verbose \\\n    -i bgfx/src\n    ./bgfx/.build/linux64_gcc/bin/shadercRelease \\\n    -f f_simple.sc \\\n    -o f_simple.bin \\\n    --platform linux \\\n    --type fragment \\\n    --verbose \\\n    -i bgfx/src\n    $(CC) main.cpp -o  main $(COMPILER_FLAGS) $(LINKER_FLAGS) $(BGFX_HEADERS)\n\nNext up we want to load our shaders into memory and into bgfx::ProgramHandle so that we can use them to render our square.\n#include &lt;fstream&gt;\nbgfx::ShaderHandle loadShader(const char* _name) {\n    char* data = new char[2048];\n    std::ifstream file;\n    size_t fileSize\n    file.open(_name);\n    if(file.is_open()) {\n        file.seekg(0, std::ios::end);\n        fileSize = file.tellg();\n        file.seekg(0, std::ios::beg);\n        file.read(data, fileSize);\n        file.close();\n    }\n    const bgfx::Memory* mem = bgfx::copy(data,fileSize+1);\n    mem-&gt;data[mem-&gt;size-1] = '\\0';\n    bgfx::ShaderHandle handle = bgfx::createShader(mem);\n    bgfx::setName(handle, _name);\n    return handle;\n}\n\nbgfx::VertexBufferHandle m_vbh;\nbgfx::IndexBufferHandle m_ibh;\nbgfx::ProgramHandle m_program; // we create a program handle\n\n...\n    // after creating the vertex and index buffers\n    // we initialize our programhandle\n    bgfx::ShaderHandle vsh = loadShader(\"v_simple.bin\");\n    bgfx::ShaderHandle fsh = loadShader(\"f_simple.bin\");\n    m_program = bgfx::createProgram(vsh,fsh,  true);\n...\n\n\nWe're so close. We have everything we need to start rendering a square on the screen. We need to define where the camera is and where it is looking at.\n#include &lt;bx/math.h&gt;\n\n// inside the while loop\n\nconst bx::Vec3 at  = { 0.0f, 0.0f,   0.0f };\nconst bx::Vec3 eye = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 10.0f };\n\n// Set view and projection matrix for view 0.\nfloat view[16];\nbx::mtxLookAt(view, eye, at);\n\nfloat proj[16];\nbx::mtxProj(proj,\n            60.0f,\n            float(WIDTH)/float(HEIGHT),\n            0.1f, 100.0f,\n            bgfx::getCaps()-&gt;homogeneousDepth);\n\nbgfx::setViewTransform(0, view, proj);\n\n// Set view 0 default viewport.\nbgfx::setViewRect(0, 0, 0,\n                  WIDTH,\n                  HEIGHT);\n\nbgfx::touch(0);\n\n\nNext we define a 4x4 matrix that defines where our square is going to be and what orientation it is at. We also set the index and vertex buffer handles and then submit the drawing with the program.\n\nfloat mtx[16];\nbx::mtxRotateY(mtx, 0.0f);\n\n// position x,y,z\nmtx[12] = 0.0f;\nmtx[13] = 0.0f;\nmtx[14] = 0.0f;\n\n// Set model matrix for rendering.\nbgfx::setTransform(mtx);\n\n// Set vertex and index buffer.\nbgfx::setVertexBuffer(0, m_vbh);\nbgfx::setIndexBuffer(m_ibh);\n\n// Set render states.\nbgfx::setState(BGFX_STATE_DEFAULT);\n\n// Submit primitive for rendering to view 0.\nbgfx::submit(0, m_program);\n\nbgfx::frame();\n\n\nAnd thats it!

I had to dig in to really make sense of how the shaders needed to be and how to set up the camera. I hope that integrating bgfx on Ubuntu would be an easier task for you now. Between the examples and the docs, it is fairly easy to figure out the corresponding steps for other platforms.

Livelike allowed me the freedom to explore my interests while also teaching me how efficient systems that deliver are setup amidst the chaos. I am proud to have been part of the team that worked with FIFA World Cup VR coverage with multiple broadcasters by building over 30 apps simultaneously. I got to experience VR on the frontlines and ride the wave of desire for this technology. I also experienced intense sporting events up close, and got the best seats, albeit virtual ones.\n\nIt was a joy watching the team grow from a motley crew of a few trying to deliver at 4 a.m to a well-oiled machine that knows what is expected and how to deliver. I switched multiple teams and even led one for a short while. I made friends and I am thankful for this time at Livelike.\n\nMini Livelike Resume\nIn somewhat chronological order:\n\nCreated an android SDK out of a Unity VR project, got it to launch, and trimmed the size of the project. This never got good enough, given the structure of the project unfortunately.\nPorted the unity project into a Xamarin SDK, trimmed size down further with dynamic scene loading.\nBuilt a show-case for Sony products in VR.\nPorted Redux and Redux-Observable to C# Unity, built on top of UniRx. Proceeded to switch major chunks of the project to Redux based state management.\nHelped and watched over the DI-fication of the project, and eventual cleanup.\nSetup a rudimentary system for static assets to be switched quickly during the build to help with multiple clients.\nUnity side of the Mosaic system for watching multiple videos at the same time.\nInherited and finished up the Highlight Center in the Unity application.\nSetup a React renderer for VR, allowing for the possible creation of VR applications with React. Used Spidermonkey for the JS engine, and got it to the POC stage.\n\n\n\n\nWorked on the initial pilot of the Livelike Engagement SDK built entirely in React Native for both Android and iOS, making the switch to the Mobile team in the process.\nSwitched to Android native SDK team, helping with architecture and initial release.\nMoved to the Producer frontend team, started with helping improve the widget creation section, switching completely to using React hooks and functional components only.\nHelped switch the entire Producer Dashboard architecture to use React hooks and functional components.\nSetup the chat moderation section for the Producer Dashboard.\n\n\nStats\n\n3 years, 4 months at Livelike\n8 offices worked at (3 at JMD, 2 at Spaze, 1 at GoodEarth, 2 at CyberPark)\n10 desk switches\n3 CEOs\n6 managers\n1 wedding\n377 pull requests on the Unity codebase, 140 on the Producer Dashboard, 13 on the Android Native SDK\nOver 50 releases spread across Unity, VR, React Native, Android, and React.\n\nWhy am I leaving?\nGot an opportunity to move away from app-related things back to a game-dev adjacent field and also to work with game-dev industry veterans. I was also getting quite comfortable at Livelike (and it is a very comfortable workplace), so much so that I stopped growing and learning new things. The team has also reached a point where I feel comfortable exiting, the bus factor is not one anymore.\nONWARDS!\n","id":"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/leaving-livelike/","title":"An update - Leaving Livelike"},"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/my-minimal-emacs-setup/":{"body":"Basic Setup\nI begin by telling Emacs what my name and email address is. This is used by tools like git when creating commits.\n(setq user-full-name \"Sandeep Nambiar\"\n      user-mail-address \"contact@sandeepnambiar.com\")\n\nGarbage collection in Emacs is quite simple. Every time memory crosses a certain threshold, it garbage collects. But the default value for this threshold is quite low by modern standards, just 800KB. Most extensions of Emacs use considerably more memory than that and this low threshold makes Emacs quite slow when using them. I set it something more reasonable like 50MB. Another low threshold is hit when opening files with sizes that are common nowadays and Emacs warns you about being wary of opening such a large file. I increase that limit too. I have RAM to spare.\n(setq gc-cons-threshold 50000000)\n(setq large-file-warning-threshold 100000000)\n\nEverything needs to be UTF-8. I have to be careful when opening files from sources other than my systems but in general, UTF-8 is preferred everywhere.\n(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)\n(set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)\n(set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)\n(set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)\n\n\neli-zaretskii :  If your system's locale specifies UTF-8, these settings are redundant, as Emacs does that by default. And if your system's locale is not UTF-8, you will get yourself in trouble, e.g., by assuming that your keyboard talks UTF-8.\n\nSetup package manager and use-package\nEmacs becomes truly useful with its package manager and thousands of freely available packages from its wonderful community. Use-package is a utility library that lets us declaratively setup the packages we will be using.\n(require 'package)\n(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)\n(add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.org/packages/\"))\n(add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"gnu\" . \"http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/\"))\n(package-initialize)\n\n(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)\n  (package-refresh-contents)\n  (package-install 'use-package))\n\n(eval-when-compile\n  (require 'use-package))\n\nVisual Setup\nVisual defaults for Emacs have a menu bar, scroll bars on all buffers and a toolbar as well. But most functionality can and should be reached through just keyboard commands, which means most of this is just visual clutter. I like a clean Emacs look so I get rid of the menu bar, the tool bar, the blinking cursor and the scroll bar.\n(menu-bar-mode -1)\n(toggle-scroll-bar -1)\n(tool-bar-mode -1)\n(blink-cursor-mode -1)\n\nNext I enable a bunch of visual helpers like line numbers, current line highlighting, column number and file size in the mode line.\n(global-hl-line-mode +1)\n(line-number-mode +1)\n(global-display-line-numbers-mode 1)\n(column-number-mode t)\n(size-indication-mode t)\n\nI never use the startup Emacs screen anymore so I disable that as well. This leads Emacs to load up with the scratch buffer open.\n(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)\n\nThe model-line has the current file's name but the path to the current file is still a few keystrokes away. The title bar can be used to show the full path of the current file, so lets set that up.\n(setq frame-title-format\n      '((:eval (if (buffer-file-name)\n       (abbreviate-file-name (buffer-file-name))\n       \"%b\"))))\n\nDefault scrolling has some wierd quirks in Emacs, so I set margins that trigger scroll to zero and preserve screen position when jumping around.\n(setq scroll-margin 0\n      scroll-conservatively 100000\n      scroll-preserve-screen-position 1)\n\nI use the font \"Hack\" which you can find at this link and set that to be the frame font. I am still trying to figure out a way to setup font size that works on different screen resolutions but for now it is set to 12.\n(set-frame-font \"Hack 12\" nil t)\n\nOne of the things I liked about Visual Studio Code editor was the default theme. Fortunately there's an Emacs package for it. Doom-one is my go to modern minimal theme. We also disable the default warning audio bell and replace it with a visual \"bell\" where only the mode-line flashes to warn you about something.\n(use-package doom-themes\n  :ensure t\n  :config\n  (load-theme 'doom-one t)\n  (doom-themes-visual-bell-config))\n\nSmart mode line is a sexy mode line for Emacs. I also like the powerline theme for the mode line. The other option is Spaceline, the mode line from spacemacs, but I think it is more work to set that up.\n(use-package smart-mode-line-powerline-theme\n  :ensure t)\n\n(use-package smart-mode-line\n  :ensure t\n  :config\n  (setq sml/theme 'powerline)\n  (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'sml/setup))\n\nBackups\nEmacs likes to strew its backup and temporary files everywhere. Lets give them a home in the temporary file directory.\n(setq backup-directory-alist\n      `((\".*\" . ,temporary-file-directory)))\n(setq auto-save-file-name-transforms\n      `((\".*\" ,temporary-file-directory t)))\n\nEase of life\nYou can get fairly tired by typing a full \"yes\" or \"no\" to Emacs' questions. So I replaced that with a simple \"y\" or \"n\"\n(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)\n\nIf I edit a file outside of Emacs, the default setting is for Emacs to ask you to reload the file manually. I task Emacs to reload the file automatically.\n(global-auto-revert-mode t)\n\nTabs are 4 spaces.\n(setq-default tab-width 4\n              indent-tabs-mode nil)\n\nWhen I say kill a buffer (close a file), Emacs asks which one. I'd rather it kill the current buffer I am in.\n(global-set-key (kbd \"C-x k\") 'kill-this-buffer)\n\nAccidental whitespaces are annoying. And I let Emacs know it. So it cleans up behind me when I save a file.\n(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'whitespace-cleanup)\n\nDiminish lets you hide minor modes from showing in the mode line, keeping it minimal.\n(use-package diminish\n  :ensure t)\n\nSmartparens is a minor-mode for dealing with paren pairs in Emacs. It inserts them in pairs, deletes them in pairs, highlights them and generally makes life easier when dealing with braces, quotes and the like.\n(use-package smartparens\n  :ensure t\n  :diminish smartparens-mode\n  :config\n  (progn\n    (require 'smartparens-config)\n    (smartparens-global-mode 1)\n    (show-paren-mode t)))\n\nSelecting a region becomes smarter with expand region which keeps selecting an increasing region based on dwim syntax.\n(use-package expand-region\n  :ensure t\n  :bind (\"M-m\" . er/expand-region))\n\nSome useful defaults are provided by the crux package of Prelude fame. \"C-k\" now kills a line if nothing is selected. \"C-a\" now toggles between first letter on the line, or beginning of the line.\n(use-package crux\n  :ensure t\n  :bind\n  (\"C-k\" . crux-smart-kill-line)\n  (\"C-c n\" . crux-cleanup-buffer-or-region)\n  (\"C-c f\" . crux-recentf-find-file)\n  (\"C-a\" . crux-move-beginning-of-line))\n\nGiven the thousands of commands at your disposal, its only reasonable to have a package help you figure out the next keystroke. which-key package opens a small buffer at the bottom with suggestions for next keystroke and possible commands that are available.\n(use-package which-key\n  :ensure t\n  :diminish which-key-mode\n  :config\n  (which-key-mode +1))\n\nI can jump around in the current visual field using avy's go to char.\n(use-package avy\n  :ensure t\n  :bind\n  (\"C-=\" . avy-goto-char)\n  :config\n  (setq avy-background t))\n\nAutocomplete and syntax checking\nI use company mode to provide completion and flycheck to do syntax checking and enable them globally.\n(use-package company\n  :ensure t\n  :diminish company-mode\n  :config\n  (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-company-mode))\n\n(use-package flycheck\n  :ensure t\n  :diminish flycheck-mode\n  :config\n  (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode))\n\nProject setup\nNo project is begun without git and Emacs community's integration with git through magit is unparalleled in its expanse and ease of use. Setting that up is just as easy. \"C-M-g\" now triggers a git status buffer for the current file's repository.\n(use-package magit\n  :bind ((\"C-M-g\" . magit-status)))\n\nProjectile is a project manager that lets you easily switch between files in a project and seamlessly between projects as well. I use it with helm which I set up below.\n(use-package projectile\n  :ensure t\n  :diminish projectile-mode\n  :bind\n  ((\"C-c p f\" . helm-projectile-find-file)\n   (\"C-c p p\" . helm-projectile-switch-project)\n   (\"C-c p s\" . projectile-save-project-buffers))\n  :config\n  (projectile-mode +1)\n)\n\nHelm\nHelm requires its own heading. It is a dwim fuzzy completion framework for Emacs and makes navigating Emacs a much nicer experience overall. I like to setup Helm to be a comfortable 20 pts in height and bind the most frequent Emacs commands like \"M-x\" with the helm equivalents.\n(use-package helm\n  :ensure t\n  :defer 2\n  :bind\n  (\"M-x\" . helm-M-x)\n  (\"C-x C-f\" . helm-find-files)\n  (\"M-y\" . helm-show-kill-ring)\n  (\"C-x b\" . helm-mini)\n  :config\n  (require 'helm-config)\n  (helm-mode 1)\n  (setq helm-split-window-inside-p t\n    helm-move-to-line-cycle-in-source t)\n  (setq helm-autoresize-max-height 0)\n  (setq helm-autoresize-min-height 20)\n  (helm-autoresize-mode 1)\n  (define-key helm-map (kbd \"&lt;tab&gt;\") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; rebind tab to run persistent action\n  (define-key helm-map (kbd \"C-i\") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; make TAB work in terminal\n  (define-key helm-map (kbd \"C-z\")  'helm-select-action) ; list actions using C-z\n  )\n\nI combine it with projectile to show project files through a helm fuzzy find interface.\n(use-package helm-projectile\n  :ensure t\n  :config\n  (helm-projectile-on))\n\nDaemon Mode\nAt the end I start the Emacs server so that any new frames that I open don't have to load the configuration from scratch.\n(require 'server)\n(if (not (server-running-p)) (server-start))\n\nYou can find my full Emacs configuration at my github repository.\n","id":"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/my-minimal-emacs-setup/","title":"My Minimal Emacs Setup"},"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/my-setup/":{"body":"Website\nThis website is built using zola.

Emacs-lsp is a client for Language Server Protocol which, in Microsoft's words:-\n\nAdding features like auto complete, go to definition, or documentation on hover for a programming language takes significant effort. Traditionally this work had to be repeated for each development tool, as each tool provides different APIs for implementing the same feature. A Language Server is meant to provide the language-specific smarts and communicate with development tools over a protocol that enables inter-process communication. The idea behind the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is to standardize the protocol for how such servers and development tools communicate. This way, a single Language Server can be re-used in multiple development tools, which in turn can support multiple languages with minimal effort.\n\nccls is a stand-alone server implementing the Language Server Protocol for C, C++, and Objective-C languages.\nGetting ccls\nYou can follow the instructions to build and then install ccls. TLDR: Make sure you have all the dependencies, clone ccls repository, download llvm binaries, build with cmake, install with cmake.\nAt the end of the process, you should have ccls in your path. If you don't want to install or cannot install ccls, just remember the path to the release binary that you get after the build process.\nEmacs-lsp\nFirst lets ensure we have emacs-lsp installed. lsp-ui provides additional ui flair along with flycheck integration. company-lsp integrates company with lsp.\n(use-package lsp-mode :commands lsp :ensure t)\n(use-package lsp-ui :commands lsp-ui-mode :ensure t)\n(use-package company-lsp\n  :ensure t\n  :commands company-lsp\n  :config (push 'company-lsp company-backends)) ;; add company-lsp as a backend\n\nThen we can setup ccls. It uses flymake for its syntax checking. We can disable that to let flycheck do its thing.\n(use-package ccls\n  :ensure t\n  :config\n  (setq ccls-executable \"ccls\")\n  (setq lsp-prefer-flymake nil)\n  (setq-default flycheck-disabled-checkers '(c/c++-clang c/c++-cppcheck c/c++-gcc))\n  :hook ((c-mode c++-mode objc-mode) .\n         (lambda () (require 'ccls) (lsp))))\n\nThat is it. When you open a new c++ file, ccls should ask you for the root of the project and make sense of how your project is structured more or less on its own. You can also configure a project to help ccls by following the instructions here.\nHappy Coding!\n","id":"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/setting-up-emacs-for-cpp/","title":"Emacs setup for C++"},"https://www.sandeepnambiar.com/sliding-puzzle/":{"body":"I built a bunch of javascript games while learning the phaser framework.
