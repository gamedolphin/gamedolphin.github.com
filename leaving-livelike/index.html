<p>After 3 short years at Livelike, and a whirlwind of exciting projects, I am moving on now. Livelike allowed me the freedom to explore my interests while also teaching me how efficient systems that deliver are setup amidst the chaos. I am proud to have been part of the team that worked with FIFA World Cup VR coverage with multiple broadcasters by building over 30 apps simultaneously. I got to experience VR on the frontlines and ride the wave of desire for this technology. I also experienced intense sporting events up close, and got the best seats, albeit virtual ones.</p>
<p><img src="/images/livelike_og.jpg" alt="Livelike India 2017" /></p>
<p>It was a joy watching the team grow from a motley crew of a few trying to deliver at 4 a.m to a well-oiled machine that knows what is expected and how to deliver. I switched multiple teams and even led one for a short while. I made friends and I am thankful for this time at Livelike.</p>

<h2 id="mini-livelike-resume">Mini Livelike Resume</h2>
<p>In somewhat chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created an android SDK out of a Unity VR project, got it to launch, and trimmed the size of the project. This never got good enough, given the structure of the project unfortunately.</li>
<li>Ported the unity project into a Xamarin SDK, trimmed size down further with dynamic scene loading.</li>
<li>Built a show-case for Sony products in VR.</li>
<li>Ported Redux and Redux-Observable to C# Unity, built on top of UniRx. Proceeded to switch major chunks of the project to Redux based state management.</li>
<li>Helped and watched over the DI-fication of the project, and eventual cleanup.</li>
<li>Setup a rudimentary system for static assets to be switched quickly during the build to help with multiple clients.</li>
<li>Unity side of the Mosaic system for watching multiple videos at the same time.</li>
<li>Inherited and finished up the Highlight Center in the Unity application.</li>
<li>Setup a React renderer for VR, allowing for the possible creation of VR applications with React. Used Spidermonkey for the JS engine, and got it to the POC stage.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-am-i-leaving">Why am I leaving?</h2>
<p>Got an opportunity to move away from app-related things back to a game-dev adjacent field and also to work with game-dev industry veterans. I was also getting quite comfortable at Livelike (and it is a <em>very</em> comfortable workplace), so much so that I stopped growing and learning new things. The team has also reached a point where I feel comfortable exiting, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> is not one anymore.</p>
<p>ONWARDS!</p>
